### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Bartosz :grinning:.

I'm working as a software engineer :technologist:.

I'm developing software in [#csharp](https://github.com/topics/csharp) and [#dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet), but I also like to experiment :test_tube: with other programming languages and technologies.

I use GitHub to learn ðŸŒ± and explore ðŸ”­ new things about software development.
